MINOS
================


MINOS is a small ROM Monitor I wrote for the Ithaca Audio Z80 CPU card inside my S-100 computer.
The monitor is coded in C (SDCC compiler) and assembly and is very small (under 2K) to fit on a 2716 EPROM.

Supported functions:
* Port IN/OUT
* Memory READ/WRITE
* Jump execution to an address
* XModem data upload
